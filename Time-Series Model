# Time-Series Model.
Transform the provided record-level dataset into a time-series model. The main objective of this model is to gain insights into the temporal patterns of vehicle listings, with a particular emphasis on conducting an inventory analysis over time, segmented by regions. For instance, the model should facilitate the creation of a time-series chart that represents the number of available vehicles over time, filtered by specific criteria such as region, vehicle type, etc. This will aid in understanding regional demand-supply dynamics, seasonal trends, and other relevant insights.
