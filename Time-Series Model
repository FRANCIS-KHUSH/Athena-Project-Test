# Time-Series Model.
Transform the provided record-level dataset into a time-series model. The main objective of this model is to gain insights into the temporal patterns of vehicle listings, with a particular emphasis on conducting an inventory analysis over time, segmented by regions. For instance, the model should facilitate the creation of a time-series chart that represents the number of available vehicles over time, filtered by specific criteria such as region, vehicle type, etc. This will aid in understanding regional demand-supply dynamics, seasonal trends, and other relevant insights.

Step 1:
I will import the necessary packages, handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and convert the "posting_date" to a datetime data type.

#load all the neccessary packages that i will use in the notebook. 

import pytz
import warnings
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=FutureWarning)
