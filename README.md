Time-Series Model: Transform the provided record-level dataset into a time-series model. The main objective of this model is to gain insights into the temporal patterns of vehicle listings, with a particular emphasis on conducting an inventory analysis over time, segmented by regions. For instance, the model should facilitate the creation of a time-series chart that represents the number of available vehicles over time, filtered by specific criteria such as region, vehicle type, etc. This will aid in understanding regional demand-supply dynamics, seasonal trends, and other relevant insights.

Data Enrichment Recommendations: Identify a few areas of additional data you would need to drive more valuable analyses, including why this data is essential and the types of analyses it would enable. (Google Doc: 1 page maximum.)


Data Warehouse Structure: Propose a design for a data warehouse structure that seamlessly integrates the existing dataset and the newly proposed data sources. This design should consider the needs of different stakeholders, ensure democratization of data, promote its efficient usage, and be scalable for future needs. (Google Doc: 1 page maximum for written content - any diagrams can be added to an appendix.)
