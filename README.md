# Craigslist's Used Vehicles Solution

# Time-Series Model.
# My Approach:

First, I handled the missing values in the dataset. I resolved this by filling in the missing values with the median and mode of numerical and categorical data on the respective columns.

Then, I converted the data types of the columns in the dataset to the appropriate data types, I converted the posting_date column should be converted to a datetime data type.

I then used the posting_date column to create a datetime index for the dataset, this allowed me to easily analyze the temporal patterns of the data.

Once I had clean data I explored it using different visualizations and statistical analysis approached. I used this step to analyze temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and demand-supply dynamics by region and vehicle type.And finally with a good understanding of the data, I created the time-series charts.

The Second reason is it is impossible to preview the notebook on GitHub since the Panda's scripts file and visuals it too huge. To solve this I have used Notebook Viewer to show the notebook.
